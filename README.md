## INTRODUCTION

Single Page Application.
Desktop has a wallpaper that fits the viewport.
There are three selectable icons in the homepage and they open an "app"by using a modal.The modal also has a button to close an app.
Selecting the start button will display a list of text and icons and the taskbar also shows the current date and time.
